You mentioned being anxious and tired. This could be a symptom of being overwhelmed. If you're feeling tired and anxious frequently, it could be because you are not giving yourself enough time to do all the things you need to do. I would recommend scheduling out your days and dedicating blocks of time to accomplish your tasks. This will help you feel more in control of your time and decrease your feelings of overwhelmed. You could also consider taking on fewer tasks so that you have more time to spend on the ones you do take on.\"}\n"

My advice to you is to take some time to grieve your cat's loss, but also think about what might have been done to him so that you don't make the same mistake next time. Some people find comfort in detailed thinking about causes and possibilities and I recommend finding a form of this with friends or family to help you cope.\"}\n"
